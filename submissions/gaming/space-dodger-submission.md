## Project
**Name:** Space Dodger Game  
**Category:** Gaming  

## Description
Space Dodger Game is a mini arcade game where players control a spaceship to dodge asteroids.  
**Objective:** Provide a fun game while testing Soundness Layer (SL) integration for score storage and player verification.  

## SL Integration
- Using Soundness Layer for:  
  - Transparent on-chain score storage.  
  - Player verification via SL identity.  
  - Enabling decentralized leaderboard.  

## Technical
### Architecture
- Frontend: React-based game running in-browser.  
- Backend: Node.js API connecting to blockchain.  
- Blockchain: Soundness Layer + EVM testnet.  
- Storage: WALRUS/IPFS for score and avatar storage.  

### Stack
- Frontend: React + Canvas/WebGL  
- Backend: Node.js  
- Blockchain: SL + EVM-compatible  
- Storage: WALRUS/IPFS  

## Features
- Spaceship control to dodge asteroids.  
- Leaderboard stored on SL.  
- Player verification with SL ID.  

## Timeline
### PoC (2–4 weeks)
- Basic playable game.  
- SL integration for score saving.  
- Simple UI.  

### MVP (4–8 weeks)
- Full leaderboard implementation.  
- Polished UI.  
- Community testing.  

## Innovation
What makes it different: a simple yet transparent arcade game where scores cannot be tampered with since they are stored directly on Soundness Layer.  
Players can prove their achievements with on-chain IDs.
